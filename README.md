# Mutt Match Project 1

### Overview

![alt text](Assets/images)

We used the PetFinder API and Ebay API.

The PetFinder allows a user to find dogs within a certain area.

In this project a user can search for a dog by entering the fields on the index page. 

The results will come back into a carousel, with additional picture of the each unique dog within a modal.
There is an inner carousel within this modal that displays those additional images.

These carousels are touch friendly.

A player will be displayed an image of either correct or incorrect depending on the answer.

### Additional Information
This project also uses the Ebay API, which returns results within the inner modal of products relating to that dog.
The content of Ebay Api is based off on the size of the dog.


**Enjoy!**
